# parkingspace.me with pugjs

I rewrote my first website, _parkingspace.me_, but this time I'm using pugjs to reduce the amount of repeating code blocks.

The left side is the first 40 lines of code from the initial version of the website and the one on the right side is the base layout written in pugjs. I was able to reduce about 50% of entire code for `index.html`.
